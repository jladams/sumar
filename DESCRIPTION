Description: A set of tools that you can use to retrieve and manipulate data
    from Suma, a free and open source tool developed at North Carolina State
    University's Hunt Library to measure space usage. Suma comes with reporting
    built in, but using their API to extract the raw data allows for more granular
    and customized analysis using R. Originally created for the Suma instance set up
    at Dartmouth College, but should be usable for others.
